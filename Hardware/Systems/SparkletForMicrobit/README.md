# EagleCAD Hardware Design files for Sparklet for micro:bit

# Acknowledgments
The Booster/Charger module design in the SparkletForMicrobit is based on the [Adafruit Powerboost 1000 Charger](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2465)

The amazing engineers at Adafruit created a perfectly optimized module to combine a LiPo charger and 5V booster at a current consumption within the limits of the Sparklet display. Thanks AdaFruit!
